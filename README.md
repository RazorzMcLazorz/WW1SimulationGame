Objectives
1. Simulate with students what Entangling Alliances are like.
2. Winning: The country with the most wealth at the end of the game wins.
Set Up
1. Organize class into 7 teams. Assign them their country names. Then let them know there point values.
Distribute 20,000 dollars to each country.
2. Now have each country decide their roles
a. Roles include: Leader (Emperor, Czar, King, President, etc.), Financial Advisor, Diplomat
3. Explain rules of how to obtain alliances and Trade agreements (listed in section labeled ‘Order of Play’)
4. When it comes to the negotiation phase, besides rules already established, anything can happen.
Order of Play
1. Diplomatic Phase
a. Representatives of each country go around getting offensive alliances, defensive alliances, and
trade agreements.
b. Diplomats bring around alliance sheets to the various leaders.
c. The only person allowed to sign alliances is a nation’s leader.
d. Both the leader and the financial advisor can sign trade agreements.
2. War Phase (version 1)
a. Leaders of each nation will turn in a small paper declaring war or peace for that round. If they
declared war they must specify who they are attacking in the note.
b. If a country declares war they must show their offensive alliance sheet to see who is joining
them. The nation being attacked then shows their defensive alliance sheet to see who supports
them.
c. If a supporting nation is found on both alliance sheets they must decide who they wish to
support by having the leader write his decision down and handing it to the teacher.
d. Add up the country power points, the side with the most wins. The winning countries each get
10,000 from the teacher. The Losing countries must give up 5,000 to the teacher.
e. Any country not involved in the initial war may still declare war. But once a country is involved in
a war, whether they initiated it or was just a supporter, they may not go to war again that round
unless they are attacked by another country.

f. Once the war is over the teacher will re-arrange the countries power order according to who
won and who lost.
Example: Lets say Germany and its ally France are attacked by Russia, Britain and the Ottomans. The
power re-arrange might look as such;
Germany 1500 ------ Russia 1500
Russia 1400 --------- Britain 1400
Britain 1100 -------- Ottomans 1100
France 1000 --------- Austria 1000
Austria 800 ---------- France 800
Ottomans 700 -------Germany 700
Italy 600 ------------- Italy 600

2b. War Phase (version 2)

a. Every leader turns in a note saying whether they declare war of peace. If they declared war they
must specify who they are attacking.
b. If a country declares war they must show their offensive alliance sheet to see who is joining
them. The nation being attacked then shows their defensive alliance sheet to see who supports
them.
c. Once each war is shown up on the board and who is allied with who. It then comes down to
dividing up a country’s available power points.
Example: France is attacking Italy while being attacked by Austria and Germany. France
will then decide where the 1000 points they have available will go. They could put in 500 for
attacking Italy and go with 500 to defend against Austria which leaves 0 to defend against
Germany.
d. (The rest of the phase goes along with what version 1 says)

3. Trade Phase
a. After wars are declared and finished the teacher will ask for all trade agreements.
b. For each country a nation has a trade agreement with they receive 3,000.
c. They only thing that nullifies an agreement is if two nations that signed an agreement went to
war against each other in the war phase.

Once finished with the Trade Phase everyone must throw away all their alliance sheets and trade agreements
and start over fresh for the next round.
